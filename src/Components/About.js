          I am a Full Stack Web Developer who loves cats and being bad at video
          games. I have finally made the move to look for a developer job now as
          I feel like I have more confidence in my coding ability. I've been
          around tech since my high school days and I highly enjoyed every
          second of it. I love to see my projects come alive as I code.
